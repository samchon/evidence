/**
 * Pairs reviews by semantic host, resolved target, and acknowledgement kind.
 *
 * Real Markdown requirements and TypeScript declarations exercise pairing after
 * adapter reconciliation. A review on another part of a merged declaration can
 * belong to the same host, while identical target text on an unrelated function
 * must not borrow that host's evidence.
 *
 * 1. Create Pricing and Tax requirements and compute their current fingerprints.
 * 2. Put Pricing evidence on an interface and its review on the merged namespace;
 *    require no review finding for that shared semantic identity.
 * 3. Add three independent invalid review scenarios and verify that:
 *
 *    - A positive review of a Tax exclusion produces one wrong-kind finding.
 *    - A Pricing review on an unrelated host produces one orphan finding.
 *    - Two reviews on one acknowledgement produce one duplicate finding.
 * 4. Require no derivative missing-review finding for the wrong-kind pair, so the
 *    diagnostic identifies the actual repair rather than reporting it twice.
