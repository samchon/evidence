/**
 * Shared selection rules for declarations that carry a claim's evidence.
 *
 * A claim selects files and symbol kinds whose public declarations may host
 * acknowledgements. Its references independently select the target units those
 * hosts must answer. A host remains selected even without a tag, allowing
 * checklist and cardinality policies to detect an unanswered declaration.
 *
 * Configuration planning resolves inherited severity and artifact defaults,
 * validates disabled declarations, and omits inactive populations from loading
 * and watch. The generic parameters restrict each artifact's discriminator and
 * supported selector vocabulary without adding a separate language option.
 *
 * @example
 * const claim: IEvidenceClaimBase<"typescript", "function"> = {
 *   type: "typescript",
 *   files: ["src/*.ts"],
 *   symbol: "function",
 *   reference: [
 *     { type: "markdown", files: ["requirements.md"] },
 *     { type: "swagger", file: "openapi.json" },
 *   ],
 * };
 * // Both reference populations require independent coverage.
