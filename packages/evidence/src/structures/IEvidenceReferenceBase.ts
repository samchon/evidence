/**
 * Shared selection and coverage policy for one referenced population.
 *
 * A reference creates an independent obligation within its claim. Ordinary
 * evidence and permitted exclusions cover selected targets and their selected
 * descendants. Unselected structural ancestors can remain addressable so
 * authors can cite an aggregate scope without changing the required
 * population.
 *
 * The optional policies tighten different parts of that obligation:
 *
 * 1. `noEvidenceExclude` requires positive evidence rather than non-applicability.
 * 2. `uniqueEvidence` limits positive semantic hosts for each selected unit.
 * 3. `singleEvidencePerSymbol` requires one selected target per claim host.
 * 4. `requireReview` validates a paired review against current target content.
 *
 * Defaults are permissive. A strict reference and a permissive reference can
 * judge the same annotation differently without changing the shared inventory.
 * Artifact-specific interfaces add file selection and, for Markdown, checklist
 * semantics that require every host to answer every item.
